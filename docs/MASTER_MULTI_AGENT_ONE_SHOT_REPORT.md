# MASTER MULTI-AGENT ONE-SHOT EXECUTION REPORT

Date: 2026-03-29 (UTC)
Repository in hand: `DSG-Deterministic-Safety-Gate`
Base branch checked: `main`

## Coordinator status
- budget_used: minimal local scan only (no external GitHub API calls from this workspace)
- mode: save
- skipped_to_preserve_quota: cross-repo network scans and duplicated repository traversals
- confirmed: local repository structure, formal artifact files, runtime endpoints in this repo

## 1) Current Verified Reality

Facts from files in this checkout:
- This repository self-identifies as the canonical reference implementation for DSG and exposes `dsg-core/`, `sdk/js/`, `schemas/`, `docs/`. 
- The Python reference node (`dsg-core/src/dsg/main.py`) exposes `/health`, `/evaluate`, and `/ledger/verify`.
- A second service implementation exists under `reference-node/app/main.py` with authenticated endpoints for `/execute`, `/ledger`, and `/audit/*` routes.

## 2) Verified Formal Core

Verified fact from local artifact files:
- Formal verification artifacts are present in SMT-LIB v2 and documented as proving determinism, safety invariance, and constant-time bound for DSG core.
- Reproduction command is documented as `z3 artifacts/formal/dsg_full_proof.smt2` with expected result `sat`.

Scope boundary (also from files):
- The formal artifact explicitly does not verify runtime orchestration, monitoring pipelines, billing/org flows, or cross-repository product assembly.

## 3) Source of Truth Map

Within this repository only:
- Gate/decision truth: `dsg-core/src/dsg/gate.py`
- HTTP reference node truth (core): `dsg-core/src/dsg/main.py`
- Ledger implementation truth: `dsg-core/src/dsg/ledger.py`
- Harmonics/stability scoring truth: `dsg-core/src/dsg/harmonics.py`, `dsg-core/src/dsg/stability.py`
- Reference operational API truth: `reference-node/app/main.py`
- Formal theorem truth: `artifacts/formal/dsg_full_proof.smt2`, `artifacts/formal/VERIFIED_CORE.md`

Cross-repo canonical map requested by prompt:
- จุดนี้ยังยืนยันไม่ได้จากไฟล์และข้อมูลที่มองเห็นอยู่
- มองไม่เห็น repo/file/config ที่จำเป็นต่อการสรุปจุดนี้

## 4) Repo Classification

Classification possible from current workspace:
- `DSG-Deterministic-Safety-Gate`: **canonical** for formal DSG core artifact + reference implementations.

For other listed repositories in prompt:
- ไม่มีหลักฐานพอจะสรุปเป็น fact

## 5) Problems Actually Found

- The previously discussed Next.js runtime patch target (`lib/dsg-core.ts` and `app/api/audit/route.ts`) is not present in this repository tree.
- Cross-repository runtime/product-loop verification cannot be completed from this checkout alone.
- There are two runtime surfaces in one repo (`dsg-core` FastAPI and `reference-node` FastAPI). This is not wrong, but requires explicit contract alignment ownership to avoid drift.

## 6) Cross-Agent Synthesis (Simulated roles using local evidence)

- Agent A (Repo Mapper): confirmed structure and entry points for `dsg-core`, `reference-node`, `sdk/js`, `schemas`, `docs`.
- Agent B (Architecture): confirmed the repo claims canonical DSG reference scope and beta boundary.
- Agent C (API/DB/Event): confirmed concrete routes in `reference-node/app/main.py`; database and models live under `reference-node/app/`.
- Agent D (Mission Control/Web): no web mission-control frontend found in this repo tree.
- Agent E (Decision/Safety/Proof/Ledger): confirmed ALLOW/STABILIZE/BLOCK decision path in `dsg-core/src/dsg/gate.py` and proof/ledger emission.
- Agent F (Runtime/Sandbox/Mirror/Mobile): runtime is Python service-based in this repo; no sandbox/world-mirror module clearly named as such.
- Agent G (Auth/Billing/Usage/Org): API-key auth exists in `reference-node`; billing/subscription loop not evidenced in this checkout.
- Agent H (Integrator): consolidated findings and generated this report.

## 7) Unification Plan

Minimal, evidence-based plan:
1. Declare this repository as canonical for formal gate + Python reference behavior.
2. Add explicit cross-repo integration matrix only after opening each listed repository directly.
3. Keep formal-core claims strict and separate from runtime/product claims.
4. Align route/response contracts between `dsg-core` and `reference-node` (follow-up task in-repo).


## 7.1) Immediate Merge Sequence (No Additional Live API Dependency)

Based on current visible evidence plus user-confirmed status:
- Already merged: PR #25, #26, #33.
- Open/pending at latest check: PR #34 (read-side normalization), PR #35 (build-unblock follow-up for #34).
- PR #36 status: จุดนี้ยังยืนยันไม่ได้จากไฟล์และข้อมูลที่มองเห็นอยู่

Recommended execution order (operationally safe):
1. **Stabilize read-side chain first**: merge **#35** only if it is required to make **#34** green; then merge **#34** immediately after verification on `main`.
2. **Resolve #36 explicitly**:
   - If #36 is the fallback policy patch for `lib/dsg-core.ts` and CI is green, merge #36 in the same release window as #34/#35.
   - If not green, keep #36 queued after #34/#35 and avoid coupling release gates to it.
3. **Collapse duplicate PR lines to one survivor** (do not keep parallel PRs in same lane):
   - either merge newest and close superseded PR,
   - or rebase older PR and close others,
   - but end with **one** canonical PR stream.
4. **After read-side closure**, open/merge a dedicated change for execute-contract mismatch (control-plane vs canonical DSG core).
5. **Finish small env/docs debt** from #26 notes (`.env.example` alignment + docs sync) as final cleanup PR.

Release-gate checklist for this sequence:
- one active PR per concern at merge time
- green CI on base `main` before merge
- post-merge smoke check for read-side endpoints + build
- explicit contract diff note for execute-plane changes

## 8) Files / Repos To Change

Changed now:
- `docs/MASTER_MULTI_AGENT_ONE_SHOT_REPORT.md` (new report file)

Not changed (insufficient visibility):
- all other repositories listed in the user execution prompt.

## 9) Exact Changes

- Added a one-shot execution report documenting:
  - confirmed local facts,
  - strict evidence boundaries,
  - source-of-truth map,
  - repo classification status,
  - formal-core vs runtime gap,
  - next minimal unification steps.

## 10) Git Actions Performed

- create file with report
- stage report file
- commit on current branch
- PR draft metadata generated via tool

## 11) Commit Message

`docs: add one-shot multi-agent execution report from local repo truth`

## 12) PR Draft

Title:
- `docs: add one-shot multi-agent execution report from local repo truth`

Body:
- Adds a structured one-shot execution report based only on files visible in this workspace.
- Distinguishes verified formal core from unverified cross-repo runtime/product claims.
- Records blockers for cross-repo truth mapping when repositories are not locally visible.

## 13) Risks / Impact

- Low runtime risk: docs-only change.
- Main risk is interpretation drift if external repos are assumed without direct evidence.

## 14) Missing Info But Continued Anyway

- มองไม่เห็น repo/file/config ที่จำเป็นต่อการสรุปจุดนี้
- จุดนี้ยังยืนยันไม่ได้จากไฟล์และข้อมูลที่มองเห็นอยู่

## 15) Hard Blockers

- No direct local visibility into the other listed repositories in this workspace, so cross-repo canonical/supporting/overlap classification remains incomplete.

## Addendum (Execution Prompt Alignment)

- Requested mode acknowledged: **REAL PRODUCT ONLY + NO-BACK-AND-FORTH + QUOTA SAFE + VERIFIED DSG CORE**.
- Coordinator decision in this workspace: execute local-repo verification path, skip unverifiable cross-repo assertions.
- GITHUB_CONTEXT status for multi-repo live scan: **NOT_READY** (other listed repositories are not visible in this filesystem checkout).
